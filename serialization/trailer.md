# Data Serialization with Python

Welcome new and returning students!  

This course addresses many aspects of data serialization, using the Python programming language.  

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series of course on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an intermediate familiarity with the Python language.  Data serialization is an important topic for several reasons that will be relevant for almost all developers and data scientists.

* It allows you to save program states when you resume execution.
* It allows you to share data among cooperating services or servers.
* It allows you to share data with programs created in other programming languages.

In the few hours of this course, we take a look at a number of different serialization formats, and compare their strengths and weaknesses for a particular purpose.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
