# Bash Scripting for Data Scientests

Welcome new and returning students!

This course shows data scientists how to achieve the most by
using the bash command line and terminal commands.  Despite
what may feel cryptic at first, the power of what you can
accomplish, efficiently and reproducible, by creating
piplines of cooperating small tools is truly amazing.  Bash
lets you do that once you become familiar with it.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a
series of courses on software development and data science
that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an at
least a moderate experience in working with data and files.
However, you may only have worked with them in GUI tools,
and more manually in the past.

Topics we cover in the four and a half hours of this course
include terminal operations, "affordances" of command
shells, small tools working together, pipelines, searching,
filtering, archiving, and retrieving data from the internet.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
