# Regular Expressions with Python

Welcome new and returning students!  

This course dives both-feet first into using regular expressions in Python. 

When working with text, we are often interested in identifying and manipulating complex patterns. 

Regular expressions provide a compact and powerful way—albeit often a confusing way as well—of working with there patterns

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series of course on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an beginning familiarity with the Python language. 

A bit more that half of this course teaches you regular expressions themselves, and barely touhes Python per se.

This part will be equally applicable to many tools and programming languages. 

In the remainder we will look at APIs specific to Python for working with regular expressions.

The exercises throughout will give you hands-on practice with the the techniques addressed in the lessons.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
