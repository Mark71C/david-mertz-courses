The thing to understand is that a \"second\" in UTC—and in all the timezones that are defined by offsets from UTC—is **not a measure of time**.  It is a measure of the angular rotation of the Earth.  Specifically, it is approximately 15.041 seconds of angular longitude (relative to the sun).  This odd number comes from the fact that Earth needs to rotate slightly more than 360° to return to facing the sun because of simultaneos prograde revolution around the sun."
