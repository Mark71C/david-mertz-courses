# Date and Time Management with Python

Welcome new and returning students!  

This course addresses many issues of date and time management within the Python programming language.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series of course on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an beginning familiarity with the Python language.  Date and time handling is an important topic that will be relevant for almost all developers and data scientists.

* You will need to identify timestamps and other time markers written in a variety of formats.
* You will need to measure the durations between such timestamps and/or generate timestamps that reflect a duraion elapsing.
* You will need to deal with events whose time is recorded relative to different local time zones, and coordinate those.

In the two hours of this course, we take a look at both the standard library and a widely used third-party library that enhances the capabilities Python itself.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
