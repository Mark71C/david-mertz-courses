    "In this exercise we continue with a similar setup to the other exercises.  We generate 50 files on disk, each of them containing 20 Natural Numbers below 100, one per line.  In a similar manner to the prior exercise, our program wishes to operate with 20 threads, each of them dealing with one line number of each corresponding file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, each thread, named 'Line-N' (where N is the number of the line it handles), will read a series of instructions that consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the content of three specified files, 'A', 'B', and 'C'.\n",
    "2. Shuffle the values on line N between the files in a \"clockwise\" fashion.\n",
    "3. Write each file to disk with adjusted content.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if line 17 of the files initially contain A=23, B=14, and C=99 , after one operation, the several line 17s will become A=99, B=23, and C=14.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with other examples, for these small files on a fast disk, a serial approach remains faster.  But as the problem scales to larger files with slower access, threads would begin to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are twin dangers here.  If you simply write to the same file from different threads, without locks, you will most likely encounter a race condition where one thread's shuffle overwrites a file that should have a different line shuffled in another thread.  On the other hand, if every file is locked before use, different threads may try to acquire competing resources in a circular manner, causing deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `oplist` variable contains entries like below, describing an action.  Each thread should only act on those actions addressed to it and disregard all others (as mentioned, a serial approach would achieve the functional purpose, but is not what this exercise is for).  This poses no danger because reading through `oplist` in each thread is **read-only** and no race condition can hence occur. Thinking about the problem will let you realize that shuffles must be performed in the exact listed order, per line, to obtain the same final state.  Operation descriptions look something like this:\n",
