# Concurrency in Python

Welcome new and returning students!

This course looks at the mechanisms for concurrency—and sometimes for
parallelism—that are provided by the Python standard library.  Python gives you
both thread-based and process-based libraries, as well as high-level wrappers
around those mechanisms.

We also look at the pitfalls of concurrency.  Most specifically, race
conditions and deadlocks.  Approaches to solve these issues are covered.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series of course on
Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an intermediate familiarity
with the Python language.  We touch of a few more advanced concepts as well,
but at a level which I anticipate students with a moderate Python knowledge
will benefit from.

Topics we cover include:

* Concurrent.futures
* Thread basics
* Sharing data among threads
* Locks, race conditions, and deadlocks
* The Python Global Interpreter Lock
* Multiprocessing

In the four and hours of this course, I provide a broad overview of concurrency
techniques. We both identify speed advantages and work through pitfalls in
these lessons.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
