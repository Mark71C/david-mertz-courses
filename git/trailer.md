# GitHub and Version Control

Welcome new and returning students!

This course, GitHub and Version Control teaches software 
developers, data scientists, or other technical workers, 
how to utilize `git` for version control, and how to use 
GitHub for powerful collaborative workflows.  These skills 
with be useful for every task related to software 
development and data analysis.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a
series of courses on software development and data science
that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an at
a moderate experience in working with data and code.  It
assumes a basic familiarity with working at a command line.
Students who are not yet comfortable with the command line
might benefit from the INE course Bash for Data Scientist.

Topics we cover in the four hours of this course include 
creating repositories, sharing them, collaborating with
other developers, making bug reports and feature requests,
and controlling access permissions on GitHub.

Files to work with are available in a repository 
accompanying this course.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
