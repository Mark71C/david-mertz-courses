# Unit Testing in Python

Welcome new and returning students! 

This course dicusses the standard library that comes with nearly every Python distribution.  Python has an attitude and a slogan of "batteries included." This is to say, very much of what you wish to do with Python can be accomplished with only the tools accompanying the language itself.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series of course on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an intermediate familiarity with the Python language.  We touch of a few more advanced concepts as well, but at a level which I anticipate students with a modate Python knowledge will benefit from.

Topics we cover include:

* Operating system tools
* File formats
* Data structures
* Functional programming and lazy data
* Writing scripts in Python

In the four and a half hours of this course, I provide a broad overview of most of the Python standard library, and delve deeper into many of the most powerful and useful modules.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
