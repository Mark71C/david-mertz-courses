# Unit Testing in Python

Welcome new and returning students!

This course looks at unit testing in Python, its benefits and 
available frameworks for creating unit tests.  We discuss the 
benefits of test-driven development throughout its lessons.

In particular, we address the doctest module in the Python standard 
library,the unittest package, also in the standard library, and the 
popular third-party pytest framework.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series 
of course on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an intermediate
familiarity with the Python language.  We touch on a few more advanced 
concepts as well, but at a level which I anticipate students with a 
moderate Python knowledge will benefit from.

Topics we cover include:

* Doctests
* Object-oriented tests
* Function-oriented tests
* Fixtures and test contexts
* Mocks and stubs

In the four hours of this course, I provide a broad overview of 
unit testing and the main tools used by Python programmers in 
developing them.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
