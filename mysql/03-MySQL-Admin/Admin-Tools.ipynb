Most likely, however, you would find this unecessarily cumbersome; using native administration tools is easier for most tasks."

Although the tool MySQL Workbench (https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is developed by Oracle, who holds the MySQL copyright, it is not the dominant tool in the way the the roughly corresponding tool `pgAdmin` is for PostgreSQL.  However, MySQL Workbench is flexible and free..\n",

In the Free Software world, phpMyAdmin (https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is quite capable.  Although, as the name suggests, the tool is written in PHP and exposed via a web interface, you do not need to know or use PHP code to use it.  HeidiSQL (https://www.heidisql.com/) is a similar tool, as in OmniDB (https://omnidb.org/)."
