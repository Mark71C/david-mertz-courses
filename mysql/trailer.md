# MySQL and MariaDB for Python Developers

Welcome new and returning students!

This course presents the MySQL relational database system 
to Python developers.  We look at a great deal of what makes 
MySQL an excellent choice for data storage, especially at
what distinguishes it from other database choices.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series 
of courses on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an intermediate
familiarity with the Python language, and a similar level of 
knowledge of SQL in general. 

Topics we cover include:

* The Python DB-API and multiple adapter options
* Administrative tools for MySQL
* Data definition, and creation and modification of tables, 
  indices, users, and so on
* The rich data type system of MySQL
* Using existing query functions and writing user defined functions.
* Defining views to simplify data access

In three and a half hours of this course, I delve into many
interesting corners of a powerful RDBMS.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
