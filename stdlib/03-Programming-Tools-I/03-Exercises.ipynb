    "For this exercise, you will need to create a particular API for working with track athletes at a competition consisting of several different events.  Of course, you should utilize the data structures discussed in this lesson to achieve this goal.  The API you need to follow has several constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Various medals won correspond to different prize amounts (whatever currency): Gold is 1000, Silver is 500, and Bronze is 250.\n",
    "* A `Medal` object will allow reference to these different types of medals, but will raise an exception if other attributes are accessed.\n",
    "* A runner (an instance of `Competition`) will have attributes corresponding to each type of medal, or None if no placement in an event.\n",
    "* The `Competition` class provides a `.winnings()` method to tally the winnings across events.\n",
    "* The `Competition` class provides a `.medals()` method to report on medals won, sorted from best to worst."
