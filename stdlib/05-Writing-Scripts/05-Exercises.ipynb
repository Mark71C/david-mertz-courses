    "For this exercise you will perform a few steps, in several functions, that will utilize the modules you learned about in this lesson, with minor background from other parts of this course\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of these steps, you will perform informal \"profiling\" of each operation by measuring the time it takes.  It is difficult to validate these times in the unit tests, since operations can take significantly more or less time depending on system factors outside your control (or my control as author).  Please verify yourself that your reported times seem reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptography, there is a concept of a \"one-time pad\" where a message is combined, byte by byte, with a shared random key that is as long as the message.  That is the general idea of these steps.  This exercise is **not** an complete cryptosystem, so do not use it as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with XOR'ing bytes, here is a simple example to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> mess = \"My message\".encode()\n",
    ">>> key  = \"secretsecretsecret\".encode()  # terrible key\n",
    ">>> encrypted = b''.join(chr(m^k).encode() for m, k in zip(mess, key))\n",
    ">>> encrypted\n",
    "b'>\\x1cC\\x1f\\x00\\x07\\x00\\x04\\x04\\x17'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversing it is simply XOR'ing the encrypted version with the same key segment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> b''.join(chr(e^k).encode() for e, k in zip(encrypted, key))\n",
    "b'My message'\n",
    "```"

    "* Save that key in a temporary file with a name\n",
    "* Time how long it takes to generate the key and print the number to screen\n",
    "* Perform OTP encryption of each nursery rhyme, saving the encrypted version to disk with the extra extension `.enc`.  E.g. Save `newberry.txt.enc` but do not remove `newberry.txt`.\n",
