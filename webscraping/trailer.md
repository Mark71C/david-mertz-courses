# Web Scraping in Python

Welcome new and returning students!

This course looks at web scraping in Python.  Being able to automate
interaction with websites and web pages is very often an important
means of acquiring information relevant to your business purposes.

My name is David Mertz, and I am your INE instructor for a series 
of course on Python development that this course belongs to.

For this course, we anticipate students will have an intermediate
familiarity with the Python language. I assume you are familiar
with general Python constructs and can learn APIs of new libraries.

Topics we cover include:

* Beautiful Soup
* Scrapy
* Selenium
* The Robots Exclusion Protocol

In the three hours of this course, I provide a broad overview of 
web scraping and the main tools used by Python programmers for 
that task.

I hope you enjoy and benefit from this material!
